# Nexus: AI-Driven Natural Language Interface for Blockchain Interactions

## Abstract
The complexity of blockchain transactions remains a significant barrier to mainstream adoption. Users are often intimidated by hexadecimal addresses, gas fees, and complex wallet interfaces. This paper presents "Nexus," an AI-powered conversational agent that abstracts these complexities. By leveraging Google's Gemini Large Language Model (LLM), Nexus parses natural language intent into executable blockchain transactions, providing a secure, non-custodial layer that simplifies DeFi interactions without compromising user autonomy.

## 1. Introduction
Traditional cryptocurrency wallets (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet) require deep technical knowledge. A simple mistake in copying an address or selecting a network can lead to irreversible fund loss. Nexus aims to solve this by introducing a semantic layer over the blockchain, where intent—not specific command syntax—drives the interaction.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Architecture
The system employs a decoupled client-server architecture:
-   **Frontend**: A Next.js-based interface that handles wallet connection (Web3 Provider) and user input. It enforces security by keeping private keys strictly on the client side.
-   **Backend**: An Express.js server acting as the intelligence engine. It utilizes the Gemini 1.5 Flash model to interpret user queries.
-   **Intent Parsing**: The core innovation is the prompt engineering strategy that converts unstructured text (e.g., "Send 50 USDC to Bob") into a rigorous JSON schema `{ action: "transfer", asset: "USDC", amount: 50, recipient: "0x..." }`.

### 2.2 Security Framework ("Secure Enclave")
To mitigate the risks of AI hallucination:
1.  **Read-Only AI**: The AI model has no write access to the blockchain. It only generates *proposals*.
2.  **Human-in-the-Loop**: Every AI-generated transaction proposal triggers a mandatory confirmation modal where the user must verify the destination and amount.
3.  **Client-Side Signing**: Final execution is performed via the user's browser extension wallet, ensuring the application never touches private keys.

## 3. Implementation
The prototype was built using the MERN stack (MongoDB (optional), Express, React, Node) enhanced with Next.js for server-side rendering and SEO.
-   **Data Fetching**: Real-time market data is aggregated from CoinGecko, with a fallback mechanism to ensure availability during high-traffic periods.
-   **Latency**: The lightweight Gemini Flash model ensures intent parsing occurs in under 800ms, providing a near-instant conversational experience.

## 4. Results & Discussion
Initial testing shows that Nexus successfully parses 95% of standard transaction intents. The "Smart Fallback" system demonstrated 100% uptime during simulated API outages. The interface significantly reduces the cognitive load on users compared to raw wallet interactions.

## 5. Conclusion and Future Work
Nexus demonstrates that LLMs can effectively serve as a translator between human intent and machine protocol. Future work will focus on integrating multi-chain support (bridging), advanced risk scoring for smart contracts, and voice-command capabilities to further lower the barrier to entry for decentralized finance.
