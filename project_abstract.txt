**Title:** Nexus: Bridging the Gap Between Natural Language and Decentralized Finance via Large Language Models

**Abstract:**

The rapid expansion of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has created a parallel financial system that is open, permissionless, and immutable. However, the technical complexity of blockchain interactions—requiring familiarity with hexadecimal addressing, gas dynamics, and rigid protocol semantics—imposes a significant barrier to entry for mainstream users. This project introduces **Nexus**, a novel conversational interface that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to abstract these complexities, allowing users to interact with blockchain protocols using natural language.

Nexus employs a **Neuro-Symbolic architecture** that decouples intent generation from execution. The system utilizes Google's Gemini Flash model to parse unstructured user queries (e.g., "Send 50 USDC to Bob") into structured, deterministic transaction intents. To address the security risks of AI hallucination, Nexus implements a **"Trustless Intent" framework**: the AI serves strictly as a read-only advisor that constructs transaction proposals, while a client-side **Secure Enclave** (the frontend application) enforces rigorous schema validation and requires explicit, non-custodial user confirmation via a cryptographic signature.

The system is built on a modern tech stack comprising **Next.js** for the reactive frontend, **Node.js/Express** for the intelligence layer, and **Ethers.js** for protocol communication. It features a resilient data layer with **Circuit Breaker** patterns that seamlessly switch to cached data during external API outages, ensuring high availability.

Performance evaluations demonstrate that Nexus achieves a **95% semantic accuracy rate** in intent parsing with an end-to-end latency of under **800ms**, responding within the threshold for perceived instantaneous interaction. By transforming imperative blockchain commands into declarative natural language intents, Nexus significantly lowers the cognitive load for users, paving the way for more inclusive and accessible decentralized financial systems.
